California Ultra-Speed Rail (CUSR) is train transport system with 26 stations, A-Z, lining up linearly from north to south in alphabetical order, where A is the northernmost station and Z is the southernmost station. The rails are doubled such that trains going southbound and northbound are on their own rails without sharing.  The goal of the project is to build a ticket booking and management system for CUSR.
